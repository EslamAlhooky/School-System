    <div class="about">  School vision:<br>

        • A sentence that describes the hoped-for situation that a group seeks to reach. <br>
        It expresses an attractive, realistic and honest future for the school. <br>
        It also constitutes a challenge for the school community to reach it.<br>
        • The effective clear vision plays the role of a change agent to shorten the distance<br> 
        between the "real situation" and the "hoped situation".<br>
        • A future dream in which all members of the school must participate in formulating it <br>
        and committing to the values​ and goals it contains,<br> 
        and turning it into a reality embodied on the ground.
